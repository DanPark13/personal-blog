Slouching in my chair in front of my desk I looked up at my ceiling. Headphones tight across my head blasting [Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK0Vdb1RUCk&ab_channel=FrankSinatraVEVO) as the confetti fell across my laptop screen. Cameras panning to the view of Times Square with the billboards buzzing, the loving couples kissing, and people celebrating in anticipation of the new year. Yet here I was, staring blankly at my screen with no thoughts in my head until one creeped in as the clock ticked past midnight.

"What now?"

To give some context, I've been on a journey of "self-improvement", at that point, for less than two months. I've been experimenting with a different techniques and improving different aspects of my life: whether it'd be my morning routine, specific workout plans, how I'd enter a state of Deep Work, or what tasks I'd do at certain times of the day.

However as I enter 2023, I reflected back onto the past two months I have been working to improve myself 

This year, I want to fully **optimize my life** by
- Identify as my Ideal Self
- Set up a Consistent and Sustainable Schedule
- Prioritize things of true value in life

Identify as my Ideal Self
- A forever student who is always learning
    - Software Engineering
    - Philosophy
    - Psychology
    - Business
- An Athlete
    - Athletic Training
    - Dieting
    - Looksmaxing
- Social Butterfly

With Ideal Self, I can set up a consistent schedule of atomic habits

Of course, this is not something I can consistently

Prioritize things of true value (minimalism)
- Experiences
- Relationships
- Well-being
