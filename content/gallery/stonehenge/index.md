Before heading into Bath, an hour bus ride away was the famous ruins of the prehistoric Stonehenge in Salisbury. While it is just a bunch of rocks, rather than the structure itself, the most fascinating part of Stonehenge is the supposed history (or lack thereof) of the structure. What was Stonehenge's purpose? Who built them? How did people in those times use pre-historic tools to lift up such heavy rocks (with the heaviest one at 30 tons)?

I'd definitely recommend visiting Stonehenge at least once in your life to get it off the bucket list and learn about the history of Stonehenge through the official tour guide app (which lead me to ponder more about the mysteries behind Stonehenge). However, it is definitely not something to visit regularly when you're in the UK. Even though I found the structure fasciating and quite enjoyable since it was a quick two hour visit, I'd only visit it again if I was dragged along by someone else who really wanted to go....
